          <p> With the skills and experience that I gained from University of Technology, Sydney, I would like to take these skills and experiences into the workplace that I will work for and pick up new skills to be able to improve myself. </p>
          <p>The companies that I would like to work for are:</p>
          <div class="listNew">
          <ul>
            <li>Google</li>
            <li>Amazon</li>
            <li>Microsoft</li>
            <li>Facebook</li>
            
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p> If we talk about the goals that i want to reach is that i would like to go to a countryside to see indegenous people and understand how they live and feel because of the reason that i watched some documentaries and it really effected me so much. Hovewer, we do not know that what our future is going to be but certainly all of us will die at one point.</p>
        <p>You never know what life brings to you but the only thing I believe is that nothing is impossible.</p>
