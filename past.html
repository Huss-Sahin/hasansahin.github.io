        <p>I was born in Istanbul, Turkey. Even though I was interested in different areas except for information
          technology, at the age of 14, with advanced technology, I have interacted with technology more and more.
          Also, the advantage is that one of my triplets is studying computer science that has led me to understand
          complex
          things better.</p>

        <p>The subjects that I have studied before are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>International Relations</li>
            <li> Diploma of Business Managenment</li>
            <li>Advance Diploma of Business Managenment</li>
          </ul>

        <p>I came here in Australia when I was 18. I was so excited to see new things and experienced new things that I
          have not done before such as kayaking, taking helicopter ride around Opera House and even climbing the Sydney
          Harbour Bridge. I have learnt a lot of things in life that made me who i am now, mature and compassionate
          person. As i understand more in life, i started to see the purpose in life and the importance of surrounding
          yourself with great people. </p>
