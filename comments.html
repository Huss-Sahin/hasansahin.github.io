    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>

    <p>Based on my website, I aimed to design a website that can be accessed on different internet platforms and used by
      all the users. I tried the use a minimalistic theme and chose a backround text colour according to the header
      image in order to maintain the website structure. As it can be seen that it is mostly used a high constrasting
      colours. The reason why is that I wanted website to allow people who have eye disease such as colorblind, to
      access easily and use the website. The website that I used for the colour can be found at the link below:
      <div class="listNew">
         <a href="https://coolors.co/">https://coolors.co/</a>
      </div>
      <p>Considering variety of font sizes, the font size has been chosen as Montserrat in whole entire website. The advantages of this font style is that makes the text for the user easier to read. Also, the fonts sizes and Navigator bars are not fixed which means that when you
      change the size of the screen the fonts sizes and Navigator bars are also changing according to screen size. </p>

    <h2>Accessibility </h2>
    <p>The website is compatible with all the electronic devices such as phones and tablets. Also, I aimed to make the text colour pure white so that colourbilind users can use and detect the website easily. Furthermore, the tables that made and the function of resizing feature on the website allow people to scan and read better as well. </p>&nbsp;
